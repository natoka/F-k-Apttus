My strong feeling after my 4 years worked with Apttus, if I have choice I won't work with Apttus for a second project.

# Culture and work philosophy
Which I believe is the most important for a company, like Salesforce Honesty, Open, Share and Collbarate, that why Salesforce.
In Apttus you can't find a document which describe the feature well, the culture is very pretective and old, also very hard to find helps from Apttus, you have to pay for the premier supports very time (and with a Premier support SLA)

# Solution Maturity
1. None knows the Package compoents, in our org installed 12 packages just to make the CPQ features work, and there is no ways for you to upgrade them in LIVE safely, if you like to upgrade, good luck for you.
2. . None knows how to quote as can't understand the component, so
3. Never close a case in tiem no metter have primer support or not, support always start bullshit a week, then start to work.

# Product Design
1. The data modle is over designed, in our org with has 298 Apttus object, none from Apttus can explain the more 20% object purpose, and you only use upage to 50 or the objects, others who knows why they are there, then why we need those object in our Org?
2. The product setup is design about 15 years ago, from after release the UI and process not much changes, now is 2018 and Lightning Experince, when using Apttus, like you are using Windows XP.
3. The product catelog and shop cart also slow, this is a know issue within the induestry, but Apttus never make this changes, no improvement.
4. Exception and errors popup in the screen, the developers is very experience limited, even don't know how to handle exceptions, there is no reason you popup exception to the users, at least catch them and pop in the debug log.
5. The GREATE product team, every time the success manager and supports says report to the product team and wait for the response, then NEVER response, BUT we are in production, users need the feature everying, we can't wait, and feedback from Apttus is sorry, and appricate for your understading, what the f**, is 2018 now.

# Customer Service
1. Everything is a price, without a premier support you can't get anything helps, unfortrunatly because of the product terrible quality you pretty relay on their services
2. Response is very slow, every emergency, Production issues all rely on inhouse team, and if you doesn't have an experience inhouse Salesforce team, then good luck for you.
3. You know what's Salesforce support right? Aptttus support is the other side quality and service, be sure not Salesforce style.
4. Apttus using Dynamic for the customer service, no more Salesforce Service cloud, the the case number is Case : **CAS-06324-W5X6D3**, when you contacting with Apttus support, they asking, what's you case number, then "Humm..... CAS....", if you can tell them the correct case number you are genius, what's the f**k case number, Apttus asking "Stupid!! DON'T open case!!".

# Product Quality


# Others:
1. When Apttus open the case detail page you will find out they are using DynamicCRM, what's the f**k!! you are selling Salesforce App!!
