My strong feeling after my 4 years worked with Apttus, if I have choice I won't work with Apttus for a second project.

# Culture and work philosophy
Which I believe is the most important for a company, like Salesforce Honesty, Open, Share and Collbarate, that why Salesforce.
In Apttus you can't find a document which describe the feature well, the culture is very pretective and old, also very hard to find helps from Apttus, you have to pay for the premier supports very time (and with a Premier support SLA)

# Solution Maturity
1. None knows the Package compoents, in our org installed 12 packages just to make the CPQ features work, and there is no ways for you to upgrade them in LIVE safely, if you like to upgrade, good luck for you.
2. . None knows how to quote as can't understand the component, so
3. Never close a case in tiem no metter have primer support or not, support always start bullshit a week, then start to work.

# Business Requirement


# Technical Requirement

# Others:
1. When Apttus open the case detail page you will find out they are using DynamicCRM, what's the f**k!! you are selling Salesforce App!!


# Product Design
1. The data modle is over designed, in our org with has 298 Apttus object, none from Apttus can explain the more 20% object purpose, then why w
