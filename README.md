My strong feeling after my 4 years worked with Apttus, if I have a choice I won't work with Apttus for a second project.

# Culture and work philosophy
Which I believe is the most important for a company, like Salesforce Honesty, Open, Share and Collaborate, that why Salesforce.
In Apttus you can't find a document which describes the feature well, the culture is very protective and old, also very hard to find help from Apttus, you have to pay for the premier supports every time (and with a Premier support SLA)

# Solution Maturity
1. None knows the Package components, in our org installed 12 packages just to make the CPQ features work, and there are no ways for you to upgrade them in LIVE safely, if you like to upgrade, good luck for you.
2. . None knows how to quote as can't understand the component, so
3. Never close a case in time no matter have primer support or not, support always starts bullshit a week, then start to work.

# Product Design
1. The data model is over-designed, in our org with has 298 Apttus objects, none from Apttus can explain the more 20% object purpose, and you only use up to 50 or the objects, others who know why they are there, then why we need those object in our Org?
2. The product setup is designed about 15 years ago, from after release the UI and process not many changes, now is 2018 and Lightning Experience, when using Apttus, like you are using Windows XP.
3. The product catalog and shop cart also slow, this is a known issue within the industry, but Apttus never make this changes, no improvement.
4. Exception and errors pop up in the screen, the developers is very experienced limited, even don't know how to handle exceptions, there is no reason you popup exception to the users, at least catch them and pop in the debug log.
5. The GREAT product team, every time the success manager and supports says report to the product team and wait for the response, then NEVER response, BUT we are in production, users need the feature everything, we can't wait, and feedback from Apttus is sorry, and appreciate your understanding, what the f**, is 2018 now.

# Customer Service
1. Everything is a price, without a premier support you can't get anything helps, unfortunately, because of the product terrible quality you pretty relay on their services
2. The response is very slow, every emergency, Production issues all rely on the in-house team, and if you don't have an experience in-house Salesforce team, then good luck for you.
3. You know what's Salesforce support right? Aptttus support is the other side quality and service, be sure not Salesforce style.
4. Apttus using Dynamic for the customer service, no more Salesforce Service cloud, the case number is Case:**CAS-06124-W0X6D3**, when you contacting with Apttus support, they ask, what's your case number, then "Humm..... CAS....", if you can tell them the correct case number you are genius, what's the f**k case number, Apttus asking "Stupid!! DON'T open case!!".

# Product Quality


# Others:
1. When Apttus open the case detail page you will find out they are using DynamicCRM, what's the f**k!! you are selling Salesforce App!!
