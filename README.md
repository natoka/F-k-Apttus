# F**k Apttus
## The driving force for me to set up this article is,DON'T MAKE THE WRONG DECISION AGAIN for all the Salesforcers

My which is strong feeling after my 4 years worked with Apttus, if I have choice I won't work with Apttus for a second project.

# Culture and work philosophy
Which I believe is the most important in a company, like Salesforce Open, Share and Collbarate, that why Salesforce.
In Apttus you can find a document which describe the feature well, also very hard to find helps from Apttus, you also have to pay for the premier supports.

1. None knows the Package compoents
1. None knows how to quote as can't understand the component, so
1. Never close a case in tiem no metter have primer support or not, support always start bullshit a week, then start to work.
