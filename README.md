# F**k-Apttus
The stories when work with Apttus

1. None knows the Package compoents
1. None knows how to quote as can't understand the component, so
1. Never close a case in tiem no metter have primer support or not, support always start bullshit a week, then start to work.

When Apttus open the case detail page you will find out they are using DynamicCRM, what's the f**k!! you are selling Salesforce App!!
